## Introduction

Briefly introduce the project, its purpose, and the context of the "0x1E. C - Search Algorithms" series. Mention the significance of implementing search algorithms and their applications.

## Implemented Algorithms

List and briefly describe the search algorithms implemented in this project. Include links to the source code files if possible.

- Linear Search
- Binary Search
- ... (add more as needed)

## Usage

Explain how to use the implemented search algorithms in your C program. Provide examples and code snippets.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include "search_algorithms.h"

int main(void) {
    int array[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10};
    int size = sizeof(array) / sizeof(array[0]);
    int target = 7;

    int linear_result = linear_search(array, size, target);
    printf("Linear Search Result: %d\n", linear_result);

    int binary_result = binary_search(array, size, target);
    printf("Binary Search Result: %d\n", binary_result);

    return 0;
}
