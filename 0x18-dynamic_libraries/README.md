# 0x18. C - Dynamic libraries

Welcome to the "0x18. C - Dynamic libraries" module! In this module, we'll dive into the world of dynamic libraries in the C programming language. Dynamic libraries provide a way to organize and reuse code, making your programs more modular and efficient.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Understand the concept of dynamic libraries in C.
- Create and compile dynamic libraries.
- Link dynamic libraries to your C programs.
- Manage shared library dependencies.
- Work with the dynamic loader and runtime linking.

## Introduction to Dynamic Libraries

Understand the fundamental concepts of dynamic libraries, why they are essential, and how they differ from static libraries.

## Creating Dynamic Libraries

Learn how to create dynamic libraries in C, compile them, and make them available for linking with other programs.

## Linking Dynamic Libraries

Explore the process of linking dynamic libraries to your C programs, both at compile-time and runtime.

## Managing Shared Library Dependencies

Understand how to manage shared library dependencies, including versioning and handling conflicts.

## Dynamic Loader and Runtime Linking

Delve into the workings of the dynamic loader and runtime linking, and how they facilitate the use of dynamic libraries.

## Exercises

Practice your understanding of dynamic libraries through hands-on exercises. Apply the concepts you've learned to create and use dynamic libraries effectively.

## Resources

Explore additional resources, tutorials, and documentation to deepen your understanding of dynamic libraries in C.
